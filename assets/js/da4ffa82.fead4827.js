First, developers just want to deploy, but delivering application with lower level infrastructure/orchestrator primitives is too much for them. It\'s very hard for developers to keep up with all these details and they need a simpler abstraction to "just deploy". Second, application delivery workflow is a basic need for "just deploy", but it is inherently out of scope of Kubernetes itself. The existing workflow addons/projects are too generic, they are way more than focusing on delivering applications only. These problems makes continuous delivery complex and unscalable even with the help of Kubernetes. GitOps can help in deploying phase, but lack the capabilities of abstracting, rendering, and orchestration. This results in low SDO (software delivery and operation) performance and burnout of DevOps engineers. In worst case, it could cause production outage if users make unsafe operations due to the complexity.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The latest DORA survey ","[1]"," shows that organizations adopting continuous delivery are more likely to have processes that are more high quality, low-risk, and cost-effective.
