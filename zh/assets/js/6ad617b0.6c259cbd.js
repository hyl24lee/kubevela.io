If a lot of users apply larger applications with more pods and more other resources, 3,000 applications might break the resource limit more easily.\nThe memory and CPU usage shown above is approching resource limits.

These two parameters limit the capability for controller to send requests to apiserver.\nGenerally, in order to scale up KubeVela controller, scale up the resource limits and all the program parameters mentioned above (except the reconcile interval). If you have more applications to manage, add more memory. If you have higher operation frequency, add more CPU and threads, then increase qps and burst accordingly.\nLonger reconcile interval allows more applications to handle, at the cost of longer time to fix potential underlying resource problems.
